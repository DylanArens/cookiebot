# Usage

Now that your Cookiebot plugin has been configured, let's see how we can use it.

The Cookiebot composable has two major functionalities: the <a href="https://www.cookiebot.com/en/developer/" target="_blank">consent banner</a> and the <a href="https://www.cookiebot.com/en/manual-implementation/" target="_blank">cookie declaration</a>. Here's how you can use them:

::alert{type="info"}
Using <a href="https://i18n.nuxtjs.org/" target="_blank">nuxt-i18n</a>? The locale will be used to set the culture prop for your Cookiebot implementation.

## Consent banner

For basic usage, nothing else has to be done! Just follow the example from the [configuration step](/nuxt/configuration).

## Cookie declaration

The cookie declaration generates your configured policy from the Cookiebot control center, as well as a possibility for visitors to adjust their cookie preferences. Nuxt auto-imports the composable for you, so you don't have to import it explicitly.

It can be used as follows:

::code-group

```ts [src/app.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
	const cookieDeclarationRef = ref<HTMLElement | null>(null);

	const { cookieDeclaration } = useCookiebot();

	onMounted(() => {
		cookieDeclaration(cookieDeclarationRef);
	});
</script>

<template>
	<div ref="cookieDeclarationRef" />
</template>
```
